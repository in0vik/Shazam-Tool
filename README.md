# üéµ Shazam Tool

> üîç A Python script that downloads audio from SoundCloud or YouTube, splits it into segments, and uses Shazam to identify songs within the mix.

## ‚ú® Features

- üéß Download audio from SoundCloud or YouTube URLs
- üéº Identify songs using Shazam API
- üíæ Save results to timestamped text files
- üöÄ Easy setup and usage with provided shell script

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

This project uses [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) for downloading audio from SoundCloud and YouTube.

### Linux

```sh
sudo apt install ffmpeg
pip install ShazamApi pydub yt-dlp shazamio
```

### macOS

```sh
# Install Homebrew if not already installed
# See https://brew.sh for installation instructions

brew install ffmpeg

# Optional: Create and activate virtual environment
# python3.11 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate

# If you don't have Python 3.11:
# brew install python@3.11

# Install required packages
pip install shazamio pydub yt-dlp ShazamApi
```

## üìö Usage

### Quick Start (Recommended)

Use the provided shell script for easy setup and running:

```sh
# Make the script executable (if needed)
chmod +x run_shazam.sh

# Setup environment (installs dependencies, creates venv)
./run_shazam.sh setup

# Download and process audio from URL
./run_shazam.sh download <url>

# Process all downloaded files
./run_shazam.sh scan

# Process a specific audio file
./run_shazam.sh recognize <file>

# Show help information
./run_shazam.sh help
```

### Manual Usage

The script also supports direct Python invocation with three main commands:

#### 1. Download and Process from URL

```sh
python shazam.py download <url>
```

Downloads audio from YouTube or SoundCloud and processes it for song recognition.

#### 2. Scan Downloaded Files

```sh
python shazam.py scan
```

Processes all MP3 files in the Downloads directory.

#### 3. Recognize Single File

```sh
python shazam.py recognize <file>
```

Processes a single audio file for song recognition.

## üìã Output

Results are saved in the `recognised-lists` directory with timestamped filenames in the format:

```
songs-DDMMYY-HHMMSS.txt
```

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è The generated song list can be imported into [TuneMyMusic](https://www.tunemymusic.com/)

## üìù Notes

- The script splits audio into 1-minute segments for optimal recognition
- Duplicate songs within the same mix are automatically filtered out
- Large files are processed in chunks to manage memory efficiently
